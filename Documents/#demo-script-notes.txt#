=====================

One interesting sequence:

Let's look at avg TAT, and TAT > 5 days, and TAT > 10 days
> python3 date_cubes.py agg 2020-02-03 2020-02-08

Hmmm - fairly high percentages of TAT > 10 days, let's drill by claims_analyst

> python3 date_cubes.py agg 2020-02-03 2020-02-08 claims_analyst

Hmmm - fairly high percentages of TAT > 10 days, let's drill further into igo_nigo

> python3 date_cubes.py agg 2020-02-03 2020-02-08 claims_analyst igo_nigo

Hmmm - fairly high percentages of TAT > 10 days for all of the NIGO's;
  let's look at nurse reviews also

> python3 date_cubes.py agg 2020-02-03 2020-02-08 claims_analyst igo_nigo is_nurse_review_required

Hmm -- still high percentages for both without nurse review and for with nurse review

Conclusion - do we want to tweak the durations a little to have lower TAT > 10 days ??
